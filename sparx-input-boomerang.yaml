# Example input file for SPARX64 - 1 rounds to find all characteristics 
# take round 2, x00 and x01 (0xB3E0, 0xB3E0) as alpha and alpha_prime
# beta and beta_prime= 0xB3E0 and 0 (0xB3E0 xor 0xB3E0)

# take round 2, y00 and y01 (0xD850, 0x38D3) as alpha and alpha_prime for right-halves
# beta and beta_prime= 0xD850 and 0xE083 (0xD850 xor 0x38D3)
