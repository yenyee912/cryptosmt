- chamBoom.py and sparxroundBoom.py are placeholder to hold different switch pattern
- newBoom.py is the placeholder for dealing with different cipher as the rotation and variables (X and Y) are coded differently
- 3 types of pattern coded evenly for 2 ciphers: cham and sparxround
- for clustering, MIGHT need to use back the ori file as the ori model changed, then run mode 4
- params for sparxround and cham will be finalized into YAML file
- parameters[uppertrail] is deprecated as it can be deduced from parameters[switchround]
